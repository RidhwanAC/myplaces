# myplaces

### **Description**

myplaces is a Flutter-based mobile application that displays a list of places around Malaysia. The app fetches data from an API endpoint, decodes it into a list of places, and displays them in a scrollable list with their name, state, rating, and image. Users can search for places by name using the search bar, and the list dynamically updates as they type.

Tapping on a place navigates to a detailed screen that shows the place's image, name, category, location (with a button to open in maps), and contact information. The app also handles loading states, connection errors, and timeout errors gracefully. Users can refresh the list at any time using the refresh button.

## App Flow

1. **Launch App**

   - User opens the app and the **Home Screen** is displayed.

2. **Fetch Places**

   - The app sends an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint.
   - The JSON response is decoded into a list of `Place` objects.

3. **Display Places**

   - `ListView.builder` displays the list of places, showing:
     - Name
     - State
     - Rating
     - Image (`ImageNetwork`)
   - If the request fails or times out, an appropriate error message is shown.

4. **Search Functionality**

   - The `TextField` allows users to search places by name.
   - The list updates dynamically to show only matching places.

5. **View Place Details**

   - Tapping a place navigates to the **Detail Screen**, displaying:
     - Image
     - Name
     - Category
     - Location (with a button to open in maps via `url_launcher`)
     - Contact information
     - Button to close the detail screen and return to Home

6. **Return to Home**
   - Pressing the close button navigates back to the Home Screen with the previous list intact.
